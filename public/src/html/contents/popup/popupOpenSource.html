			<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
				PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
				OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>

				<strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong><br><br>

				"Contribution" means:<br><br>

				a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
				Distributed under this Agreement, and<br><br>

				b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
				i) changes to the Program, and<br>
				ii) additions to the Program;<br>
				where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
				and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
				"originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
				such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
				Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
				are not Modified Works.<br><br>

				"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.<br><br>

				"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
				are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
				or when combined with the Program.<br><br>

				"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
				Agreement.<br><br>

				"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
				or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.<br><br>

				"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<br><br>

				"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
				results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
				contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
				in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
				Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
				interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
				in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
				or Modified Works thereof.<br><br>

				"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
				in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.<br><br>

				"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
				modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
				documentation source, and configuration files.<br><br>

				"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
				Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
				exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
				Contributor.<br><br>

				<strong>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong><br><br>

				a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
				grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
				license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
				publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
				Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.<br><br>

				b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
				grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
				license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
				import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
				if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
				apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
				the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
				of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
				Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
				combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
				licensed hereunder.<br><br>

				c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
				licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
				provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
				patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
				Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
				brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
				property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
				rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
				assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
				property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
				patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
				Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
				before distributing the Program.<br><br>

				d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
				sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
				the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>

				e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
				Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
				those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
				receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
				(if permitted under the terms of Section 3).<br><br>

				<strong>3. REQUIREMENTS</strong><br><br>

				<strong>3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:</strong><br><br>

				a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
				accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
				the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
				is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
				obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
				used for software exchange; and<br><br>

				b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
				different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
				i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
				warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
				warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
				implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
				for a particular purpose;<br><br>

				ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
				liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
				incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br><br>

				iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
				in the Source Code under section 3.2; and<br><br>

				iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
				party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
				of this section 3.<br><br>

				<strong>3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:</strong><br><br>

				a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
				Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
				files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
				Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
				Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
				under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and<br><br>

				b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
				the Program.<br><br>

				<strong>3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
				trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
				of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
				the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
				their own appropriate notices.</strong><br><br>

				<strong>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</strong><br><br>

				Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
				with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
				license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
				the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
				offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
				liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
				the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
				("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
				other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
				damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
				and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
				Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
				Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
				in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
				apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
				intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
				Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
				writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
				and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
				related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
				participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br><br>

				For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
				product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
				Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
				claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
				claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
				alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
				defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
				claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
				pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
				those damages.<br><br>

				<strong>5. NO WARRANTY</strong><br><br>

				EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
				PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
				BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
				IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
				TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
				PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
				appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
				risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
				including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
				compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
				or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br><br>

				<strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</strong><br><br>

				EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
				PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
				SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
				EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
				PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
				CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
				ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
				EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
				POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>

				<strong>7. GENERAL</strong><br><br>

				If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
				applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
				the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
				action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
				minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>

				If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
				(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
				Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
				or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
				rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
				litigation is filed.<br><br>

				All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
				fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
				Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
				time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
				rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
				and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
				However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
				granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br><br>

				Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
				but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
				may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
				reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
				this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
				Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
				is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
				responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
				entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
				version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
				Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
				received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
				Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
				Contributions) under the new version.<br><br>

				Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
				receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
				Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
				estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
				under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
				to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
				No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.<br><br>

				<strong>Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice</strong><br><br>

				"This Source Code may also be made available under the following
				Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
				in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
				version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."<br><br>

				Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
				is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

				If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
				file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
				file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
				look for such a notice.<br><br>

				You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
